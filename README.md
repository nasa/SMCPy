## Description
SMCPy is an open-source package for performing uncertainty quantification using
a parallelized sequential Monte Carlo sampler.

## Key Features
* Alternative to Markov chain Monte Carlo for Bayesian inference problems
* Unbiased estimation of marginal likelihood for Bayesian model selection
* Parallelization through either numpy vectorization or mpi4py

# Quick Start

## Installation
To install SMCPy, use pip.
```sh
pip install smcpy
```

## Overview
To operate the code, the user supplies a computational model built in Python
3.6+, defines prior distributions for each of the model parameters to be
estimated, and provides data to be used for probabilistic model calibration. SMC
sampling of the parameter posterior distribution can then be conducted with ease
through instantiation of a sampler class and a call to the sample() method.

The two primary sampling algorithms implemented in this package are MPI-enabled
versions of those presented in the following articles, respectively:

The first is a simple likelihood tempering approach in which the tempering
sequence is fixed and user-specified
([FixedSampler](https://github.com/nasa/SMCPy/blob/8b7813106de077c80992ba37d2d85944d6cce40c/smcpy/samplers.py#L44)).
The second is an adaptive approach that chooses the tempering steps based on a
target effective sample size ([AdaptiveSampler](https://github.com/nasa/SMCPy/blob/8b7813106de077c80992ba37d2d85944d6cce40c/smcpy/samplers.py#L92)).

This software was funded by and developed under the High Performance Computing
Incubator (HPCI) at NASA Langley Research Center.

## Example Usage

```python
import numpy as np

from scipy.stats import uniform

from spring_mass_model import SpringMassModel
from smcpy.utils.plotter import plot_pairwise
from smcpy import AdaptiveSampler, VectorMCMC, VectorMCMCKernel


# Load data
std_dev = 0.5
displacement_data = np.genfromtxt('noisy_data.txt')

# Define prior distributions & MCMC kernel
priors = [uniform(0, 10), uniform(0, 10)]
vector_mcmc = VectorMCMC(model.evaluate, displacement_data, priors, std_dev)
mcmc_kernel = VectorMCMCKernel(vector_mcmc, param_order=('K', 'g'))

# SMC sampling
smc = AdaptiveSampler(mcmc_kernel)
step_list, mll_list = smc.sample(num_particles=500, num_mcmc_samples=5, target_ess=0.8)

# Display results
print(f'parameter means = {step_list[-1].compute_mean()}')
plot_pairwise(step_list[-1].params, step_list[-1].weights, save=True,
              param_labels=['K', 'g'])
```

The above code produces probabilistic estimates of K, the spring stiffness
divided by mass, and g, the gravitational constant on some unknown planet.
These estimates are in the form of weighted particles and can be visualized by
plotting the pairwise weights as shown below. The mean of each parameter is
marked by the dashed red line. The true values for this example were K = 1.67
and g = 4.62. More details can be found in the [spring mass
example](https://github.com/nasa/SMCPy/blob/main/examples/spring_mass/run_example.py). To run this model in
parallel using MPI, the MCMC kernel just needs to be built with the
ParallelVectorMCMC class in place of VectorMCMC. More details can be found in the
[MPI example](https://github.com/nasa/SMCPy/blob/main/examples/mpi_example/run_example.py).

Tests
-----

Clone the repo and move into the package directory:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/nasa/SMCPy.git
cd SMCPy
```

Install requirements necessary to use SMCPy:

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Optionally, if you'd like to use the MPI-enabled parallel sampler, install the
associated requirements:

```sh
pip install -r requirements_optional.txt
```

Add SMCPy to your Python path. For example:

```sh
export PYTHONPATH="$PYTHONPATH:/path/to/smcpy"
```

Run the tests to ensure proper installation:

```sh
pytest tests
```
